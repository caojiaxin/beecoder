Presents the file stream parser that de/encoding "B-encode" data format. Thatused by the peer-to-peer file sharing system (like BitTorrent) for storingand transmitting loosely structured data.BeeCoder serialize the ByteArrayInputStream that contains raw data, of supported java objectsAnd deserialize the ObjectInputStream that contains Bencoded types of java objectsSupported types:java.lang.Integer for integersjava.lang.String for stringsjava.util.LinkedList<Object> for listsjava.util.LinkedList<Entry<String, Object>> for dictionariesSo client application doesn't needs to import some additional types.For dictionary realization was chosen LinkedList<Entry<String, Object>> instead of LinkedHashMap please see benchmark page<a href="https://github.com/soulaway/jse8collectionBenchmark">JSE8 collections insert/iterate benchmark</a>Author Dmitry G.
